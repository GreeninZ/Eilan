3D social simulation-construction game where you start on island where all buildings are destroyed and your goal is to repair it. Unique aspect of the game is To-do list where you add tasks from real life to do and when you do them you get reward in the game.

Made in Godot Engine by me and 3 of my friends at school. It was school project but I'm glad we made it.
